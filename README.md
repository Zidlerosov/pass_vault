Hello, this is my simple password vault i wrote for myself

first you need to choose a secret, you can technically store passwords under different secrets, but only if you use the sercret used when creating the password, the password will be visible

use these commands to use this program

\>ex/exit 
  to exit the program

\>w/wipe
  to cler the console and get prompted for secret again

\>generate *length*
  to generate password of *length* characters, includes lowerspace chars, upper space chars, special chars and digits, of each at least one

\>add *password*
  to add your own not-generated password

\>pull
  to show all stored passwords

Still lacks features and some error handling, but should be safe, needed something fast, told myself why not just upload it
